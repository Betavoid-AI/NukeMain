so, to train a model and save it to use later.


in the base .js file of AI, there are 2 parts -

1. The training model part:
    to use this part, you have to call the function which is createJSFileInFolder() and pass true in it.
    this will train the model and save it in a txt file located in the Trained_Models flder in the root.

2. Using the model in the txt file
    this is the part of the script that we will make the buncle of,
    this part of the script, gets the data from the txt file and stores it in the AI object and then
    uses it to give the output lightning fast.


Both of these parts are devided by a devider so as to reduce confusion.

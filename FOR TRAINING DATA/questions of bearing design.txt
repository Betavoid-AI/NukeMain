The expected life of a ball bearing subjected to a load of 9800N and working at 1000RPM is 3000 hours. What is the expected life of the same bearing for a similar load of 4900N and a speed of 2000rpm.

For ball bearings, the fatigue life L measured in number of revolutions and the radial load F are related by FL^1/2=K, where K is a constant.  It withstands a radial load of 2KN for a life of 540 million revolutions. The load (in KN) for a life of one million revolutions is.        

A ball bearing operating at a load F has 8000 hours of life. The life of the bearing, in hours, when the load is doubled to 2F is.

A journal bearing has a shaft diameter of 40mm and a length of 40mm The shaft is rotating at 20 rad/s and viscocity of the lubricant is 20mpa. s. The clearance is 0.020mm The loss of the torque due to viscocity of the lubricant is approximately.

The life of a ball bearing at a load of 10KN is 8000 hours. Its life in hours, if the load is increased to 20KN keeping all other conditions same, is.

The dynamic load capacity of 6306 bearing is 22KN The maximum radial load it can sustain to operate at 600 rev/min for 2000 hours is.
